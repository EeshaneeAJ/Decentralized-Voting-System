# Blockchain-Based Voting System  

## Overview  
This project is a **secure, transparent, and decentralized voting system** built using **Ethereum smart contracts, Web3.js, React.js, and Node.js**. The system ensures **tamper-proof elections** with real-time vote tallying, off-chain storage for efficiency, and multi-factor authentication for security. It uses **Ganache** for local blockchain testing.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js  
- **Security:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA), OTP-based login  
- **Testing & Development:** Ganache, Truffle  

## Features  
✔ **Secure Voting:** Blockchain-based, immutable votes  
✔ **Real-time Vote Tallying:** Instant results processing  
✔ **Decentralization:** Eliminates central authority manipulation  
✔ **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enhances voter security  
✔ **Off-Chain Data Storage:** Efficient handling of user data  
✔ **Local Testing with Ganache:** Simulates Ethereum network

## Setup & Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js & npm  
- Truffle & Ganache  
- Metamask (for blockchain transactions)  

### Installation Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blockchain-voting.git
   cd blockchain-voting
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```  
3. Start Ganache (for local blockchain network).  
4. Deploy smart contracts:  
   ```sh
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```  
5. Run the backend (OTP authentication):  
   ```sh
   cd otp-backend
   node server.js
   ```  
6. Start the frontend:  
   ```sh
   cd voting-website
   npm start
   ```  

## Testing  
- Run smart contract tests:  
  ```sh
  truffle test
  ```  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement a mobile app for wider accessibility  
- Optimize smart contracts for gas efficiency  
- Introduce zero-knowledge proofs for voter privacy
